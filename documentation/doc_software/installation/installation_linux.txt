******************************************************************************
This file contains the instructions how to install the executable under
Linux. Note that there is no GUI included because the engine is intended to
be used with chess GUIs via the UCI protocol.
******************************************************************************

- Since the download ZIP does not contain Linux binaries, you first have to
  build the binary. Follow the Linux build instructions in the ZIP file under
  documentation/doc_software/buildprocess/buildprocess_uci.txt .
- Create a "CT800" directory in a suitable place in your system.
- Copy the generated executable to that "CT800" directory.
- Copy also the logo PNG from the binaries/Logo-Images in the ZIP download
  file to that directory.
- Follow the instructions of your chess GUI how to register the engine with
  your chess GUI.
- The CT800 engine supports the UCI protocol only. You should select "use
  engine book" because the opening book is tuned to the engine's style.

Note: The opening book is contained in the executable file, as well as the
      endgame bitbase for KPK, so there are no additional paths to configure.

Note: The engine uses 8 MB as default size for the hash tables. For better
      performance, 256 MB are recommended, which you can control through your
      GUI.
