CppCheck v1.90 has been used for static source code analysis with errors and
warnings only.

CppCheck issues the following warnings for the CT800 application V1.40:

hmi.c , line 206:
    Array 'line1[14]' accessed at index 17, which is out of bounds.
    explanation: false positive, this line is not executed for short strings.

search.c , line 683:
    Possible null pointer dereference: blocked_movelist
    explanation: false positive, the list is guarded by blocked_moves as list
                 length. Where blocked_movelist is NULL, blocked_moves is 0.

search.c , line 1978:
    The address of local variable 'empty_p' might be accessed at non-zero index.
    explanation: false positive, the dereference is not indexed.

CppCheck does not issue unexplained warnings for the source code of:

- the CT800 UCI version (one false positive for search.c, see above)
- the book tool
- the CRC tool
- the KPK bitbase generator.


Evaluation: PASSED.
