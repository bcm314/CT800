Note: The PC version referenced here is not the UCI version, but the
development PC version under source/application. The point is to
emulate the behaviour of the actual CT800 hardware as closely as possible,
including move input and menu system. If you are just interested in the
UCI version, you can ignore this readme file.

The PC version does not use the 4x4 keypad, but the PC's keyboard. The
key mapping is as follows:

EN: y (because enter doesn't work with getch).
CL: n
a-h, 1-8 are used for coordinates.
menu access: m
position viewer: p (also after the game)
undo or < key: u or -
redo or > key: r or +
go-key: x (not working during computer's turn)
quit program: q (at any time - pay attention when queening!)
light key: not supported

So, to start a game with e2-e4, you type: "e2e4y". Pieces are not denoted
when entering a move. So if you instead want to start with Ng1-f3, you
type: "g1f3y".

Promotion is done via 1-4 or a-d:
1 = queen, 2 = rook, 3 = bishop, 4 = knight. Example: "b7b82y" pushes a
white pawn from b7 to b8, promoting on b8 and yielding a rook. If you don't
specify the promotion piece ("b7b8y"), a queen is selected.
